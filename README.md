A simple chatbot using Amazon Lex

Amazon Lex Food Delivery Chatbot

This repository contains the code for an Amazon Lex chatbot designed for a food delivery app. The chatbot enables users to place food orders through a conversational interface. It recognizes user intents for ordering non-vegetarian, vegetarian, or vegan food, and guides users through selecting their preferred food choice. 

Step 1: Create Amazon Lex Bot

Log in to your AWS account.
Go to the Amazon Lex service.
Click the "Create" button to make a new bot.
Choose the "Custom bot" option.
Name your bot, select a voice (if applicable), and set the session timeout.
Create an intent called "OrderFoodIntent" for food ordering.
Add example phrases like "I want to order non vegetarian food," "Vegetarian food options," and "Vegan food menu."
Define slots like "FoodType" (non-veg, veg, vegan) and "FoodChoice" (pizza, burger, etc.).

Step 2: Create Lambda Function for Intent Fulfillment

Create a new Lambda function called "OrderFoodFunction."
Write code in the function to handle intent fulfillment.
For example, if the user selects "Pizza," you could respond with the order details and cost.
Step 3: Configure Fulfillment with Lambda Function

Return to your Amazon Lex bot in the console.
Go to the "OrderFoodIntent" configuration.
Choose "Fulfillment" and pick "AWS Lambda function."
Select your "OrderFoodFunction" Lambda function.
Step 4: Set Up Amazon Connect

Access Amazon Connect in your AWS account.
Create a new instance for your call center.
Set up instance details like a name and routing preferences.
Step 5: Create Contact Flows and Integrations

Inside your Amazon Connect instance, find "Routing" and click "Contact flows."
Make a new contact flow to guide customer calls.
Add a block to ask for customer input, like their food preference.
Use a "Play prompt" block to play a welcome message.
Connect the blocks based on customer choices.
Include a "Invoke AWS Lambda function" block to use the Lex bot through Lambda.
Configure the Lambda block to call your "OrderFoodFunction" Lambda.
Step 6: Create Amazon Lex Integration in Amazon Connect

In your Amazon Connect instance, go to "Routing" and click "Amazon Lex."
Create a new integration with your Amazon Lex bot.
Connect the Lex bot to the contact flows you created.
Step 7: Test the Solution

Call your Amazon Connect phone number.
Follow the prompts to interact with the Lex bot for food ordering.
The call will go through the contact flow and interact with the Lex bot.
Remember that this is a simplified explanation, and you may need to tailor the steps to your specific use case. Feel free to adapt the code, configuration, and flow to match your requirements. This project demonstrates how to create a basic food ordering chatbot integrated with Amazon Connect for a call center experience.

can you elaborate step 8 of step 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's elaborate on Step 8 of creating the Amazon Lex bot:

Step 8: Define Slots and Slot Types for Food Ordering

In this step, we'll focus on defining the necessary slots and slot types for capturing user input related to food ordering. Slots are placeholders for specific pieces of information that your chatbot needs to gather from the user.

Go to your Amazon Lex bot's console page.
Find the "OrderFoodIntent" that you created earlier and click on it.
In the "Intent Configuration" section, you'll see the "Slots" tab. Click on it.
Now, let's define the slots and slot types:

Slot 1: FoodType
This slot will capture the user's preference for non-vegetarian, vegetarian, or vegan food.

Click the "Add slot" button.
For "Slot name," enter "FoodType."
For "Prompt," you can provide a prompt like "What type of food would you like to order? Non-vegetarian, vegetarian, or vegan?"
Choose "Slot type" as "AMAZON.CustomType."
Click on "Add a custom slot type" and create a new custom slot type named "FoodType."
Add the values: "Non-vegetarian," "Vegetarian," "Vegan."
Save the slot type.
Slot 2: FoodChoice
This slot will capture the user's specific food choice based on their preference.

Click the "Add slot" button again.
For "Slot name," enter "FoodChoice."
For "Prompt," you can ask "What would you like to order from the available options?"
Choose "Slot type" as "AMAZON.Food."
Note: The "AMAZON.Food" slot type is a built-in slot type that covers a variety of food items.

After defining the slots, make sure to save the intent.
By setting up these slots and slot types, you're instructing the chatbot to gather specific information from the user, such as their food preference and choice. Once the user provides this information, you can use it to generate responses and fulfill their order using the Lambda function. Remember that this is just a basic setup; you can customize the prompts, slot types, and responses according to your food delivery app's menu and user experience.

Now, let's define the slots and slot types:

Slot 1: FoodType
This slot will capture the user's preference for non-vegetarian, vegetarian, or vegan food.

Click the "Add slot" button.
For "Slot name," enter "FoodType."
For "Prompt," you can provide a prompt like "What type of food would you like to order? Non-vegetarian, vegetarian, or vegan?"
For "Slot type," choose "AMAZON.FoodType."
Note: If "AMAZON.FoodType" is not available, you can use "AMAZON.SearchQuery" or "AMAZON.Ordinal."

Slot 2: FoodChoice
This slot will capture the user's specific food choice based on their preference.

Click the "Add slot" button again.
For "Slot name," enter "FoodChoice."
For "Prompt," you can ask "What would you like to order from the available options?"
For "Slot type," choose "AMAZON.Food."
Note: The "AMAZON.Food" slot type is a built-in slot type that covers a variety of food items.

AMAZON.Ordinal, AMAZON.SearchQuery, AMAZON.FoodType , AMAZON.CustomType is not in the dropdown list
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. If those specific slot types are not available in the dropdown list, you can use the available built-in slot types to achieve a similar functionality. Here's how you can adapt the instructions for defining slots:

Step 8: Define Slots and Slot Types for Food Ordering

In this step, we'll use available built-in slot types to capture user input related to food ordering.

Go to your Amazon Lex bot's console page.
Find the "OrderFoodIntent" that you created earlier and click on it.
In the "Intent Configuration" section, click on the "Slots" tab.
Now, let's define the slots using available built-in slot types:

Slot 1: FoodType
This slot will capture the user's preference for non-vegetarian, vegetarian, or vegan food.

Click the "Add slot" button.
For "Slot name," enter "FoodType."
For "Prompt," you can provide a prompt like "What type of food would you like to order? Non-vegetarian, vegetarian, or vegan?"
For "Slot type," choose "AMAZON.LITERAL."
Slot 2: FoodChoice
This slot will capture the user's specific food choice based on their preference.

Click the "Add slot" button again.
For "Slot name," enter "FoodChoice."
For "Prompt," you can ask "What would you like to order from the available options?"
For "Slot type," choose "AMAZON.LITERAL."
Note: "AMAZON.LITERAL" allows you to capture free-form text input from the user.

After defining the slots, make sure to save the intent.
While "AMAZON.LITERAL" doesn't provide the same level of validation and predefined options as the other slot types, it allows you to capture text input that you can process in your Lambda function to determine the food type and choice. In your Lambda function, you can then perform your own validation and mapping based on the user input.

Again, I apologize for any confusion caused by the previous responses. Please adapt these instructions to fit your food delivery app's menu and user experience.

elaborate this part more detailed and simplified way ,Step 2: Create Lambda Function for Intent Fulfillment 
ChatGPT
Certainly! In this step, you'll create a Lambda function that will handle the logic to fulfill the user's food order and provide the response. The Lambda function will take the input from the Lex bot, process it, and generate the appropriate response. Here's how you can do it in a more detailed and simplified way:

Step 2: Create Lambda Function for Intent Fulfillment

Log in to AWS Console:

Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
Make sure you're in the same region where you created your Amazon Lex bot.
Create a New Lambda Function:

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Lambda service.
Click the "Create function" button.
Configure the Lambda Function:

Choose "Author from scratch."
Provide a name for your function, like "FoodOrderFulfillment."
Choose the runtime as "Python 3.8" (or any version you prefer).
Lambda Function Code:

In the "Function code" section, you'll write the code for your Lambda function.
python
Copy code
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract slot values from Lex event
    slots = event['currentIntent']['slots']
    food_type = slots['FoodType']
    food_choice = slots['FoodChoice']

    # Calculate the order cost based on food choice
    order_cost = calculate_order_cost(food_choice)

    # Generate response message
    response_message = f"Your order costs ₹ {order_cost}. Cash on delivery is available for this order. You can pay when our delivery agent arrives. Thank you for choosing us!"

    # Build response for Lex
    response = {
        "dialogAction": {
            "type": "Close",
            "fulfillmentState": "Fulfilled",
            "message": {
                "contentType": "PlainText",
                "content": response_message
            }
        }
    }

    return response

def calculate_order_cost(food_choice):
    # Implement your logic to calculate the order cost based on food choice
    # Return the calculated cost
    return 139  # Placeholder cost
This code defines a Lambda function that takes the user's food type and choice, calculates the order cost, and generates a response message.

Configure Lambda Role:

Choose "Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions" to let AWS create a new role for your Lambda function.
Provide a role name, like "FoodOrderFulfillmentRole."
Review and Create:

Review your settings and click the "Create function" button.
Integration with Lex:

After creating the Lambda function, you'll see its details page. Look for the "Function ARN" value at the top, which looks like arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:FoodOrderFulfillment.
Go back to the Amazon Lex console.
Click on the "OrderFoodIntent" intent.
In the "Fulfillment" section, choose "AWS Lambda function" and select the appropriate region.
In the "Function ARN" field, paste the ARN of the Lambda function you just created.
Save and Test:

Save the intent configuration.
You can now test your chatbot by interacting with it using the "Test Chatbot" feature in the Lex console. Provide different food types and choices to see the response.
Congratulations! You've created a Lambda function that fulfills the food ordering intent in your Amazon Lex chatbot. When users select their food type and choice, the Lambda function will calculate the order cost and generate a response message. Remember to adjust the calculate_order_cost function to implement your actual pricing logic based on the food choices in your application.

ChatGPT
Absolutely, here's the Lambda function code broken down and presented in a more detailed and aesthetically pleasing format:

python
Copy code
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract slot values from Lex event
    slots = event['currentIntent']['slots']
    food_type = slots['FoodType']
    food_choice = slots['FoodChoice']

    # Calculate the order cost based on food choice
    order_cost = calculate_order_cost(food_choice)

    # Generate response message
    response_message = (
        f"Your order costs ₹ {order_cost}. "
        "Cash on delivery is available for this order. "
        "You can pay when our delivery agent arrives. "
        "Thank you for choosing us!"
    )

    # Build response for Lex
    response = {
        "dialogAction": {
            "type": "Close",
            "fulfillmentState": "Fulfilled",
            "message": {
                "contentType": "PlainText",
                "content": response_message
            }
        }
    }

    return response

def calculate_order_cost(food_choice):
    # Implement your logic to calculate the order cost based on food choice
    # Return the calculated cost
    return 139  # Placeholder cost
This code processes the user's input from the Lex bot, calculates the order cost, and generates a response message. The response message is then formatted to be more readable and organized.

Feel free to replace the placeholder values with your actual logic and content. This code is designed to provide a clear and structured representation of how the Lambda function handles the food ordering intent fulfillment.

User
it showed this error while testing the chat bot , Cannot call DialogCodeHook for Intent OrderFoodIntent. BotAlias/LocaleId TestBotAlias/en_US doesn't have an associated Lambda Function
ChatGPT
The error message you received indicates that the Lex bot couldn't find an associated Lambda function for the specified intent in the provided bot alias and locale. This error typically occurs when the Lambda function is not correctly linked to the intent or there's an issue with the bot alias or locale.

To resolve this issue, here are the steps you can follow:

Check Lambda Function Configuration:
Ensure that you've correctly linked the Lambda function you've created to the appropriate intent. In the Lex Console, navigate to the "Fulfillment" section of the intent you're testing ("OrderFoodIntent" in this case), and make sure you've selected the correct Lambda function as the fulfillment method.

Bot Alias and Locale:
Make sure that the bot alias you're using for testing ("TestBotAlias" in your case) is associated with the correct bot and locale. In the Lex Console, navigate to the "Bot Versions" section and confirm that the bot alias you're using points to the correct bot and locale.

Publish Changes:
After making any modifications, remember to publish the changes you've made to the bot. This is important to ensure that the latest configurations are available for testing.

Test with Correct Alias:
When you're testing the bot, make sure you're using the correct bot alias and locale in your testing. If you're using the AWS CLI or SDK to interact with the bot, ensure that you're specifying the correct alias and locale in your requests.

Check Permissions:
Verify that the Lambda function associated with the intent has the necessary permissions to be invoked by the Lex bot. The Lambda function's execution role should have the "AWSLambda_FulfillmentPolicy" policy attached.

Retry Testing:
After ensuring that the above steps are correct, retry testing the bot to see if the error is resolved.

If you've confirmed that the Lambda function is correctly linked to the intent and the bot alias and locale are accurate, but you're still encountering the error, there may be a deeper configuration issue. In that case, it might be helpful to review your setup step by step, double-checking each configuration detail and making sure that there are no typos or inconsistencies.

Output Voice: Choose the voice that your bot will use to communicate with users.
Session Timeout: Set the time (in minutes) after which the bot's session will expire if there's no user activity.
Add an Intent for "OrderFoodIntent":

In the bot creation process, you'll be asked to define intents. An intent represents an action that the user wants to perform. Let's define an intent named "OrderFoodIntent."
Click on the "Create Intent" button to add a new intent.
Define Sample Utterances:

Sample utterances are example phrases that users might say to invoke a specific intent. For our "OrderFoodIntent," let's define sample utterances to cover different scenarios:
Enter each of these phrases, pressing "Enter" after each one:
"I want to order non-vegetarian food."
"Give me vegetarian food options."
"Show me the vegan food menu."
Define Slots for "FoodType" and "FoodChoice":

Slots are placeholders for the values that users provide. In our case, users will specify the food type and food choice.
Click the "+" button under the "Slots" section to add slots to the intent.
For the first slot, set the slot name as "FoodType."
Slot Type: Choose "AMAZON.CustomType" (If this option is not available, choose a similar type that fits the purpose.)
For the second slot, set the slot name as "FoodChoice."
Slot Type: Choose "AMAZON.FoodType" (If this option is not available, choose a similar type that fits the purpose.)
By following these detailed steps, you'll create a new Amazon Lex bot named "FoodDeliveryBot" with an intent called "OrderFoodIntent." This intent will have sample utterances and slots for "FoodType" and "FoodChoice." Make sure to adjust slot types based on the options available in the dropdown list.

Remember that the specifics might vary slightly based on the changes Amazon Lex has undergone since my last update in September 2021. Always refer to the latest Amazon Lex documentation for accurate instructions.

description about the above lex chatbot
ChatGPT
Certainly! The Amazon Lex chatbot you're creating is designed for a food delivery app. Here's a detailed description of how the chatbot works and what each part of it does:

Bot Overview:
The "FoodDeliveryBot" is a conversational interface built using Amazon Lex, a service that allows you to create conversational interfaces for applications. This bot is designed to help users place food orders through a chat-based interaction.

Functionality:

Introduction and Intent Recognition:
When users interact with the chatbot, they can express their intent to order food by using sample phrases like "I want to order non-vegetarian food," "Give me vegetarian food options," or "Show me the vegan food menu." The bot recognizes these intents using the "OrderFoodIntent" you defined.

Slot Filling:
The chatbot understands that there are two key pieces of information required: the type of food (non-vegetarian, vegetarian, or vegan) and the specific food choice (e.g., pizza). It uses slots to capture these pieces of information.

FoodType Slot:
The "FoodType" slot captures the type of food the user wants to order. Depending on the options available in the slot type dropdown, it might be "AMAZON.CustomType" or a similar type. The user's input is matched against the slot type's values.

FoodChoice Slot:
The "FoodChoice" slot captures the specific food item the user wants. In your example, we're using "AMAZON.FoodType" as the slot type to allow users to choose from various food options.

Response Generation:
Once the chatbot has extracted the user's chosen food type and food choice, it generates a response. If the user chooses "Pizza," it calculates the cost (₹139) and provides a message confirming the order. If the user chooses an unsupported food choice, it informs them that only pizza is available.

Fulfillment and Closing the Interaction:
The bot constructs a response payload with the calculated message. It marks the conversation as "Fulfilled" and returns the response to the user. This concludes the interaction.

User Interaction Example:

User Input: "I want to order non-vegetarian food."
Bot Interaction:
Bot extracts "non-vegetarian" as the FoodType.
Bot prompts for FoodChoice, offering options like "Pizza," "Burger," etc.
User Input: "Pizza"
Bot Interaction:
Bot calculates the cost (₹139).
Bot constructs response: "Your order costs ₹139. Cash on delivery is available. Thank you for choosing us!"
Note:

Ensure that the slot types you select align with the available options in the dropdown list provided by Amazon Lex. If you can't find exact matches, choose similar types that best fit the purpose.
Keep in mind that the example provided covers a simplified interaction. You can expand and enhance the chatbot's capabilities based on your requirements.
Remember to adapt the chatbot based on any changes or updates in the Amazon Lex service, as there may have been developments since my last update in September 2021. Always refer to the latest Amazon Lex documentation for the most accurate information.
